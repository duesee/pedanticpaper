# Pedanticpaper

The script at hand finds several mistakes when writing research papers, a spell-checker won't. This is archieved by defining a per-project configuration file.

Currently, the tool does the following:

* It checks for "evil twins", i.e. that a single notation (e.g. "side-channel") was used instead of different ones (e.g. "side channel" or "sidechannel"). This is especially useful when content is provided by multiple authors.
* It finds doublettes, i.e. "We showed that that...". This can happen due to copy-paste errors and can easily be overlooked.
* It finds non-allowed characters, i.e. difficult to spot unicode characters which may introduce parsing errors.
* It checks for consistency in titles, i.e. if the same style (e.g. upper-case style "How to write a Research Paper" or lower-case style "How to write a research paper") is used to name each section, subsection, etc.
* It warns on potentially confusing words like "proposed" and "purposed".
* It checks for wrong abbreviation, e.g. "et al" or "ie.".
* It checks for so called ["weasel words"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word).

# Sample

```
$ python main.py ./
### Starting recursive search from "./"
### Testing file "classic.tex"
[!] found non-allowed char '²' in line 3
[!] found doublette "the the" in line 3
[!] found evil twin "elliptic-curve" in line 3. Did you mean "elliptic curve"?
[!] found erroneous abbreviation "e.g " in line 3. Did you mean "e.g."?

### Testing file "ecc.tex"
[!] found doublette "is is" in line 3
[!] found evil twin "public-key" in line 3. Did you mean "public key"?
[!] found weasle word "extremely" in line 3. Can it be clarified?
[?] found potentially confusing word "purposed" in line 3. Did you mean "proposed"?

# Important

The script at hand may contain unpythonic and/or unelegant code and insult pedantic programmers. Beside from that, it does not change any files and pull-request are always welcome.
