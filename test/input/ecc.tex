\section{Elliptic curve cryptosystems}

Neal Koblitz and V.S. Miller independently purposed using \emph{elliptic curves} for public key cryptography in 1985 \cite{bruce, bruce867, bruce1095}. Today, \emph{Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)} is is one of the cornerstones of modern cryptography and widely used to implement digital signatures or key agreement protocols. The practical benefits of ECC are its much smaller key sizes and extremely more efficient implementations compared to public-key algorithms like RSA \cite{rsa, eddsa, rsavsecc}.
