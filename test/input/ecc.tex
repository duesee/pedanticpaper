\section{Elliptic curve cryptosystems}

Neal Koblitz and V.S. Miller independently purposed using \emph{elliptic curves} for
public key cryptography in 1985 \cite{bruce, bruce867, bruce1095}. Today, \emph{Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)}
is is one of the cornerstones of modern
cryptography and
and widely used to implement
digital signatures or key agreement protocols. The practical benefits of ECC are its much smaller
key sizes and extremely more efficient \todo{be more specific} implementations compared to public-
key algorithms like RSA \cite{rsa, eddsa, rsavsecc}.
