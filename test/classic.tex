\section{Classic cryptosystems}

The earliest number-theoretic public
key cryptosystems were based on the structure of the multiplicative
group $(\Z/N\Z)^*$ or the multiplicative group of a finite field $GF(p^n)$ with $p \in \PS, n \in \N$
\cite{bruce867}. This includes algorithms like \emph{Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)},
\emph{Schnorr's signature scheme} or the the \emph{digital signature algorithm (DSA)}Â².
The work at hand will cover modern signature algorithms based on \emph{elliptic-curves}.
Classical algorithms, e.g DSA or RSA, are not discussed.
